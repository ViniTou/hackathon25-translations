Evaluate the translation of content in the DXP system.
You get two JSON inputs. The first JSON is a list of field IDs and their text content. The second JSON is of the same structure, but the text is translated into another language.
As a result, return JSON with field IDs with nested fields: translationRating, translationError,  errorSeverity, suggestedTranslation, and changesExplanation;
Where translationRating is a number from 1 to 5 - 5 is the perfect translation, translationError describes what is wrong with the translation, and changesExplanation provides a nice explanation why the suggested translation is better.
